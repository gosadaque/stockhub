========

stockhub is a suite scripts that crawls investment web sites to fetch top performers' recent buy/sell transactions/ portfolios, and presents trading idea in seconds. The rationales of the tool is simply as follows: 
in 1~2 day, if a stock is bought/sold independently by multiple top performers with good track records (e.g., in term of annual return)it is more than likely to be a good idea again, at least better than a clueless amateur who under-performs market. 

If you are investment guru, no bother. If you are like me, picking "persons" than picking stocks within limited time window, this is a tool for you.

The project is named stockhub because it is a hub of collective wisdom. The tool sources data from Internet investment sites, ranging from published portfolios of professional or grass-root investors, to more casual stock trading competition postings. Some trading records are varifi-able by 3-rd parties, while others can only be cross-referenced by historical performances provided by each system.No single record is absolutely reliable, but collectively, it provide a "crowds intelligence". 

The tool is implemented by light-weighted shell scripts. You can run it on any Linux or Windows (e.g., on top of cygwin) even behind firewall. 

Disclaimer: Totally for fun.
