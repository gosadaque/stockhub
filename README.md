For each stock ticker, it rates (rating.sh) the stock by crawling/normalizing data (in HTML/JSON/CSV/... formats) from public sites including, ARK-investments; top-ranked public portfolios hosted at tipranks; investment games/competitions hosted by MotleyFool/Martwatches; SEC 13F filers; famous Youtubers/WallStreetBets(WSB/reddit) pumps and dumps, etc. 
It is designed as a light-weighted command-line tool that can be executed on any Linux-compatible console, or anywhere on web-based console (e.g. on repl.it).
